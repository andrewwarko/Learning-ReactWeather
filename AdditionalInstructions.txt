Use get init to initialize a git repository.

'git status' lets you check the status of your repository.
create a .gitignore file to remove any files you don't want committed (like node_modules)

To flag all files not ignored to be tracked, use the 'git add .' command.

git commit -m '<message>' will save the changes.

shortcut to add tracked files and commit: git commit -a -m '<message>'. This does not work for files that aren't yet tracked.

'git push' will add to github.
